In most places on Earth, a lucky viewer can see a Sun pillar, a column of light appearing to extend up from the Sun caused by flat fluttering ice-crystals reflecting sunlight from the upper atmosphere.  Usually, these ice crystals evaporate before reaching the ground.  During freezing temperatures, however, flat fluttering ice crystals may form near the ground in a form of light snow  sometimes known as a crystal fog.  These ice crystals may then reflect ground lights in columns not unlike a Sun pillar.  The featured image was taken last month across the Wulan Butong Grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2403/PillarsMongolia_Liao_6240.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Light Pillars Over Inner Mongolia","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2403/PillarsMongolia_Liao_960.jpg"}
