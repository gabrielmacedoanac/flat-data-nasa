It holds the famous pair of open star clusters, h and Chi Persei. Also cataloged as NGC 869 (top) and NGC 884, both clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young based on the ages of their individual stars, evidence that they were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Always a rewarding sight in binoculars, the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from dark locations.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2307/Caldwell_14_2023_HaLRGB_LRGB_stars_wm.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Double Cluster in Perseus","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2307/Caldwell_14_2023_HaLRGB_LRGB_stars_wm-scaled.png"}
