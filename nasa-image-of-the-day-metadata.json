Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a geomagnetic storm, alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky when a stunning fireball meteor explodes. Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers captured video and still images of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon. Though quickly fading from view, the fireball left a lingering visible trail or persistent train. The wraith-like trail was seen for minutes wafting in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of 60 to 90 kilometers along with the auroral glow.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7280-1s_1024.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Fireball over Iceland","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7280-1s_1024.jpg"}
