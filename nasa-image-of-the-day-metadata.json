One of planet Earth's most famous volcanos, an eruption of Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city of Pompeii in 79 AD.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2402/MeteorBayofNaples_V2.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Meteor over the Bay of Naples","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2402/MeteorBayofNaples_V2_1024.jpg"}
