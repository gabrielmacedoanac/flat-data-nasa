Part of a local complex of star-forming interstellar clouds they include LDN 1358, 1357, and 1355 from American astronomer Beverly Lynds' 1962 Catalog of Dark Nebulae. Presenting a challenging target for astro-imagers, the obscuring dark nebulae are nearly 3,000 light-years away, toward rich starfields in the northern constellation Cassiopeia. At that distance, this deep, telescopic field of view would span about 80 light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/Ldn1355HelpingHandFR2048.png","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Helping Hand in Cassiopeia","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2411/Ldn1355HelpingHandFR1024.png"}
