First, they are rare noctilucent clouds, meaning that they are visible at night -- but only just before sunrise or just after sunset.  Second, the source of these noctilucent clouds is actually known. In this rare case, the source of the sunlight-reflecting ice-crystals in the upper atmosphere can be traced back to the launch of a nearby SpaceX rocket about 30 minutes earlier.  Known more formally as polar mesospheric clouds, the vertex of these icy wisps happens to converge just in front of a rising crescent Moon. The featured image -- and accompanying video -- were captured over Orlando, Florida, USA about a week ago.  The bright spot to the right of the Moon is the planet Jupiter, while the dotted lights above the horizon on the right are from an airplane.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/NoctilucentFlorida_Pouquet_1966.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Noctilucent Clouds over Florida","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/NoctilucentFlorida_Pouquet_960.jpg"}
