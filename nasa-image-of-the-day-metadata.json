They have no eyes, but at times, many tentacles. They float.  Usually, they slowly change shape and just fade back onto the Sun over about a month. Sometimes, though, they suddenly explode and unleash\u00a0energetic particles into the Solar System that can attack the Earth.\u00a0 Pictured is a huge solar prominence imaged almost two weeks ago in the light of hydrogen. Captured by a small telescope in Gilbert, Arizona, USA, the monsteresque plume of gas was held aloft by the ever-present but ever-changing magnetic field near the surface of the Sun. Our active Sun continues to show an unusually\u00a0high number\u00a0of prominences, filaments, sunspots, and large active regions\u00a0as solar maximum approaches in 2025.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/SunMonster_Wenz_960.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Monster Solar Prominence","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/SunMonster_Wenz_960.jpg"}
