Beyond the man in the Moon, the night sky is filled with stories, and cultures throughout history have projected some of their most enduring legends onto the stars and dust above.  Generations of people see these celestial icons, hear their associated stories, and pass them down. Pictured here is not only a segment of the central band of our Milky Way galaxy, but, according to folklore of several native peoples of Uruguay, the outline of a great bird called \u00d1and\u00fa. Furthermore, \u00d1and\u00fa's footprint is associated with the Southern Cross asterism. In the foreground, in silhouette, is a statue of Mar\u00eda Micaela Guyunusa, an indigenous woman of the Charr\u00faa people who lived in the 1800s and endures as a symbol of colonial resistance.  The composite image was taken in mid-April in Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, with the Atlantic Ocean in the background.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2306/NanduMilkyWay_Bouvier_2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The \u00d1and\u00fa in the Milky Way","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2306/NanduMilkyWay_Bouvier_1080.jpg"}
